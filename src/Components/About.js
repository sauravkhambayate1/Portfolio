    Hello, I'm Saurav Kiran Khambayate, a recent graduate with a passion for IT. I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Savitrbai Phule Pune University. <br />
  During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in trending technologies like HTML CSS JavaScript React Node, and I'm eager to apply my learning in real-world scenarios. <br /> I have a keen interest in learning newer technologies and enjoy keeping up with the latest trends and advancements.
  Although I may be new to the industry, I'm highly motivated, a fast learner, and possess a strong work ethic. I have honed my relevant skills such as problem-solving, communication, teamwork through academic projects and extracurricular activities. <br />
 I am excited to embark on my professional journey and contribute to innovative projects. I am open to opportunities that will allow me to learn and grow as a Software developer. <br /> I'm confident in my ability to adapt and thrive in a dynamic and collaborative work environment.
 In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, attending industry events, and working on personal projects to further enhance my skills.  I am a strong believer in continuous learning and self-improvement.
I'm looking forward to connecting with industry professionals and exploring potential opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me at <span className='email'>sauravkhambayate221@gmail.com</span>. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
