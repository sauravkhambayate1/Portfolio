   I acquired a strong foundation in <span className='text_data'> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>, and I enjoy creating responsive and user-friendly web interfaces. <br /> I have hands-on experience with modern front-end frameworks like <span className='text_data'>React</span> , which I find exciting for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
 
   <br /> I am also familiar with backend development using <span className='text_data'>Node.js</span> , where I have gained experience in creating server-side logic and RESTful APIs. <br /> I find the full-stack development process intriguing and look forward to expanding my knowledge in this area.
  
    In addition to web development skills, I have worked with databases like <span className='text_data'>MYSQL</span> and <span className='text_data'>MongoDB</span> to store and retrieve data efficiently. Understanding the fundamentals of database management has allowed me to design and optimize data structures for web applications.
  
    Although I am a fresher, I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and eager to apply my skills to real-world projects. I enjoy collaborating with teams and believe effective communication is key to successful project outcomes.
